# pgrserver_demo

A flutter application to view and test major services of the [pgrServer](https://github.com/mbasa/pgrServer)
routing engine. This is used mainly for the MacOS desktop, although it will work as a Web 
as well as a mobile application. 

### Pre-requiste

A working pgrServer application service is a pre-requisite. Modify 

``` lib/res/RestParams.dart```

to point to the pgrServer if not  located on the default localhost.
